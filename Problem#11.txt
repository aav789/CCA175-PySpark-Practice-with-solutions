Instructions
	Get number of LCAs by status for the year 2016
Data Description
	h1b data with ascii null "\0" as delimiter is available in HDFS
h1b data information:
	HDFS Location: /public/h1b/h1b_data
	YEAR is 8th field in the data
	STATUS is 2nd field in the data
	There are some LCAs for which YEAR is NA, ignore those records
Output Requirements
	File Format: json
	Output Field Names: year, status, count
	Place the output files in the HDFS directory
End of Problem

Solution: 
	from pyspark.sql.functions import count

#read and create DF
	h1b=spark.read.format("csv").option("delimiter", "\0").load('/public/h1b/h1b_data')

#filter and select
	h1bf=h1b.where("_c7 =2016").selectExpr("_c0 as lca_id", "_c1 as status", "_c7 as year")

#group by
	output=h1bf.groupBy('year', 'status').agg(count('lca_id').alias('count')).selectExpr('year', 'status', 'count')
#save
	output.coalesce(1).write.mode('overwrite').format('json').save('/user/ramapilli16/sol11')

#validate 
	hdfs dfs -ls /user/ramapilli16/sol11/

	hdfs dfs -cat  /user/ramapilli16/sol11/part-00000-d389bd8d-7440-42f4-bc50-09da86f5e877-c000.json |more

Spark-SQL
	h1b.createTempView("h1b")
	output =spark.sql("select _c7 as year, _c1 as status, count(_c0) as count from h1b where _c7=2016 group by _c1,_c7")
