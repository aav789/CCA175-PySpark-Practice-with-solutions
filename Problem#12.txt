Instructions
	Get top 5 employers for year 2016 where the status is WITHDRAWN or CERTIFIEDWITHDRAWN or DENIED
Data Description
	h1b data with ascii null "\0" as delimiter is available in HDFS
	h1b data information:
HDFS Location: /public/h1b/h1b_data
	YEAR is 8th field in the data
	STATUS is 2nd field in the data
	EMPLOYER is 3rd field in the data
	There are some LCAs for which YEAR is NA, ignore those records
Output Requirements
	File Format: parquet
	Output Fields: employer_name, lca_count
	Data needs to be in descending order by count
End of Problem

solution

	from pyspark.sql.functions import count,desc, dense_rank
	from pyspark.sql.window import *

#read and create DF
	h1b=spark.read.format("csv").option("delimiter", "\0").load('/public/h1b/h1b_data')

#filter and select
	h1bf=h1b.where("_c7=2016 AND _c1 IN ('WITHDRAWN', 'CERTIFIEDWITHDRAWN', 'DENIED')").selectExpr("_c0 as lca_id", "_C2 as employer_name")

#group
	h1bg=h1bf.groupBy('employer_name').agg(count('lca_id').alias('lca_count')).selectExpr('employer_name','lca_count') 

#top 5
	output=h1bg.withColumn('drank', dense_rank().over(Window.orderBy(desc('lca_count')))).where("drank <=5").orderBy('lca_count', ascending=False).selectExpr('employer_name','lca_count')

#save
	output.write.mode('overwrite').format('parquet').save('/user/ramapilli16/sol12/')

Spark-SQL
	h1b.createOrReplaceTempView('h1b')
	h1bg=spark.sql("SELECT _c2 as employer_name, count(_c0) as lca_count  FROM h1b WHERE _c7=2016 AND _c1 IN ('WITHDRAWN', 'CERTIFIEDWITHDRAWN', 'DENIED') GROUP BY _c2")
	
	h1bg.createOrReplaceTempView('h1bg')
	output= spark.sql("SELECT employer_name, lca_count FROM (SELECT *, dense_rank() over(order by lca_count desc) as drank FROM h1bg) T WHERE T.drank<=5 ORDER BY lca_count DESC")
