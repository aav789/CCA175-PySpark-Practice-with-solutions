Instructions
	Get number of LCAs filed for each year
Data Description
	h1b data with ascii null "\0" as delimiter is available in HDFS
	h1b data information:
HDFS Location: /public/h1b/h1b_data
	Ignore first record which is header of the data
	YEAR is 8th field in the data
There are some LCAs for which YEAR is NA, ignore those records
	Output Requirements
	File Format: text
	Output Fields: YEAR, NUMBER_OF_LCAS
	Delimiter: Ascii null "\0"
End of Problem

Solution:
	from pyspark.sql.functions import count, concat_ws
	h1b=spark.read.format("csv").option("delimiter", "\0").load('/public/h1b/h1b_data')

filter and select
	h1bf=h1b.where("_c7 !='NA'").selectExpr("_c0 as lca_id", "_c7 as YEAR")

validate -> this should be empty 
	h1bf.where("YEAR ='NA'").show(5)

output and save

	output=h1bf.groupBy('YEAR').agg(count('lca_id').alias('NUMBER_OF_LCAS')).selectExpr("concat_ws('\0', YEAR, NUMBER_OF_LCAS) as result")

	output.coalesce(1).write.mode('overwrite').format('text').save('/user/ramapilli16/sol10/')

Validate result  
	hdfs dfs -ls /user/ramapilli16/sol10/

	hdfs dfs -cat  /user/ramapilli16/sol10/part-00000-228be0ec-5348-406c-8784-f585df5e1976-c000.txt

Spark-SQL
	h1b.createTempView("h1b")
	output =spark.sql("select _c7 as year, count(_c0) as count from h1b where _c7!='NA' group by _c7")
